  <h3>Failure</h3>

<p>I never failed anything before college.  I might not have had the highest GPA in my school, or maybe I lost the top tennis position to a ringer, but I didn’t fail.  My family took academics very seriously.  Whether instilled by my parents, sisters, schools, or what, we had a well-know grade system.  An ‘A’ is an ‘A’.  A ‘B+’ is a ‘C’.  And a ‘B-’ is an ‘F’.  There might be exceptions provided for unusual special classes, but for core curriculum that was the model.  I don’t think I ever failed anything with this grade system.  Or if I did, I have blotted it from my memory.</p>

<p>Then I went to Caltech…</p>

<p>During the years I spent at Caltech we had 33% attrition.  One in every three students simply didn’t graduate from Caltech.  Ever.  Most of them wandered away after freshman year.  A bunch more vanished after sophomore first quarter.  I couldn’t have chosen any school other than Caltech after I was accepted, but it was a brutal education for most of us.  They have changed “the catalog” quite a bit since then, so don’t let my description dissuade you or your children from the school.  Talk to a more recent graduate and let them dissuade you ☺</p>

<p>The reason for the sophomore exodus is that Caltech was Pass/Fail freshman year, so besides having possibly harder courses, sophomore first quarter is also the first graded quarter.  I had a hard time with Caltech, but it wasn’t the grades.  I was quite ahead in math and a bit in physics, so I placed out of a total of three course-years of work.  During freshman year I was taking a good number of sophomore level courses.  And about the same number of freshman level courses.  And I definitely learned how to fail.  Big time.</p>

<p>Most fails don’t actually become fails on your transcript, because you can see your trajectory and after a few weeks you can drop courses.  So if you sign up for six courses, see the failures coming, you can drop maybe two of the six and hunker down on the remaining four.  If you went below four, you “went on the radar” of the academic committee, and they might force you to take some time off.  But if it only happened say once a year, they would probably let it slide.  Back then, you were not allowed to go to Caltech part time.</p>

<p>I failed things for all kinds of reasons.  Sometimes the material was insanely hard.  I always had bad study habits.  I won the 10:1 odds and had an amazing woman that I wanted to be with.  And sometimes I had bad karma.</p>

<p>The worse karma I ever had back then was in a VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) course.  The scale has changed, and the layers are different, but if you look at a current CPU… that is VLSI.  I don’t know if they have augmented the name.  In any case, I absolutely loved VLSI.  It combines building electronic circuits with graphic design.  I loved both of these things, even taking a year from Caltech to study graphic design at UCLA.</p>

<p>As part of the VLSI course, there is a contest.  Who can build the smallest “Full adder” .  A full adder can handle adding a binary digit to another binary digit, including the carries in (from the right) and out (to the left).  I loved this contest.  I relished the chance to prove I had the graphical skill to lay out this relatively simple circuit in the smallest space possible.  VLSI is actually multiple layers, and transistors are kind of like traffic lights, so this challenge is like laying out a three-dimensional set of intersections such that you can have the tightest road density possible.  Manhattan on steroids (or Jetsons).</p>

<p>Loved the challenge and put hours into it.  We all submit our homework, and the professor or TAs review them all.  The next class, the professor shows the outline of all the different solutions.  Basically bunches of squares and rectangles inside one another with the smallest in the center.  It is hard to be sure the scale and squares are not a very distinct object.  But I hope I am near the center.</p>

<p>Next the professor calls my name.  He tells everyone that I am the smallest design, by a large margin actually.  But.  It doesn’t work.  My smallest square has a thin line around it.  It needs a thick line.  That shows it works.  Mine doesn’t.</p>

<p>Testing VLSI in the 1980s is not very easy.  The tool we students are using can’t simply run the electronics.  It is basically a drawing tool.  So I drew a three dimensional picture in a square that was supposed to work as a circuit, but the professor or TAs claim it does not.  I don’t know if they had the tools to check it.  Or they eyeballed something that I couldn’t see.</p>

<p>Later I go see the professor.  I ask if he can explain what is wrong with my solution.  I really can’t figure out the problem.  He tells me to go figure it out myself.  He was not the nicest professor at Caltech.</p>

<h3>Community</h3>

<p>Palo Alto has many labeled neighborhoods.  If you look at a Google map of the city you will see them: Professorville, Old Palo Alto, Leland Manor, Triple El, and so on.  I think I count twenty-four of them.  Palo Alto is 24 square miles, so a neighborhood for every square mile.  Seemed a bit strange at first, but now it just is.  We used to live in Leland Manor, Steve Jobs lived in Old Palo Alto, one of Maya’s friends lives in Downtown North, and we now live in St. Claire Gardens.  The naming system is actually very convenient and a little more artistic than the LA driving directions.</p>

<p>But living in a labeled neighborhood does not create a community.  You need people to create communities.  When we lived in Leland Manor we had Rebecca’s aunt two doors away, a very nice family diagonally opposite, and a couple more semi-social households.  Our next-door neighbors were very quiet, either due to age on the one side or to the stresses of paying for a million dollar house on the other.  Our neighborhood was not a community until one family, really one person, insisted that it should be.  I will call her ‘V’.</p>

<p>V moved to Palo Alto from San Francisco.  Her parents live a couple towns north, in Atherton, but it seemed as though for most of her adult life, V wanted to be quite independent from them.  V’s family included a son the same age as Katrina, and later would include a daughter a bit younger.  V was a firefighter.  When the decision had to be made, she decided the risk to her family was not worth the early retirement that the occupation provided.  So V simply dropped the ‘fire’ off her occupation.</p>

<p>V and her family fought with the tiny house they were given, and turned it into a very nice layout, with an amazing kitchen, and all the necessities for a tight family.  V and her family fought with the yard, and now it is a farm and has a tree that Katrina can’t keep her hands off.  V fought to have the neighbors all know each other, and with yearly block parties and just general social interaction, that ultimately became a reality.  We had a community in Leland Manor, and V was the glue.</p>

<p>At approximately the same time that V glued together our proximate neighbors, we were becoming an integral part of another community.  Somehow Rebecca had heard of a nursery school called Parents Nursery School, and we were now a part of it.  When Rebecca and I were looking for nursery schools, we saw a number of different variations.  Some were clean and pleasant, some were clean and almost industrial, some were a bit more disorganized, and then there was PNS.  PNS seemed to be a war between Kids and Nature, and Adults and Order.  The kids were winning, and the adults were happy to see it, if a bit frazzled trying to keep them alive.</p>

<p>Where modern playgrounds have nice rubber surfaces, PNS simply put tires on top of the ‘curb’ that surrounded the play structures. Where most schools tried to protect their flora, the kids at PNS would constantly be bouncing on the trees and running through the ivy.  At PNS, kids were free to be kids, as long as they did not hurt each other, they included each other in their activities (“you can’t say you can’t play”), and they at least approximately did what the teacher said they should do.</p>

<p>PNS was a cooperative.  Parents were actually “in school” learning how to teach children.  There were also mandatory nighttime classes, but the bulk of the time was spent in school.  Rebecca was the primary time-contributor to all our cooperative schooling, but when Maya went through PNS, I was there fairly often too.  Sometimes I was there in the main part of the school day, but more likely during working weekends.  One year I drew all different kinds of smiley faces on the playground tires when I re-holed them.  The holes were to let water drain, and the faces showed ‘up’.  Another time I helped rebuild a water table.  And another I dug a hundred holes to stash buried treasures for the kids to find.  PNS was a lot of fun, and was definitely an important community to us.</p>

<h3>Horses and Dragons and Rams</h3>

<p>Being of both western and eastern decent, our family has two zodiacs that we know.  The western zodiac says we are a bull, a ram, and two scorpions.  That doesn’t really make much sense with our personalities, so it is ‘amusing’.  The eastern zodiac says I am a fire horse.  That totally fits: I was running full speed, blazing over the hills of eastern America.  I felt like something totally alien to my environments. I was having fun, but I didn’t belong here.  Then I came to California, and on a brief visit to Catalina, I saw, on the top bunk, another fire horse.  Rebecca.  And from that point forward I wanted to run with her.  We have been running together for 30 years.</p>

<p>Maya is a golden dragon.  That totally fits too.  Maya is amazing.  She is very quiet while being very social.  She has great humility while having incredible talents.  She is a hidden dragon.  She looks like a young woman, but she could conquer the world.  Fortunately she seems to be a very friendly and good dragon.</p>

<p>Katrina is a water ram.  That <em>totally</em> fits.  Katrina is also amazing, but the first thing you will encounter with her is a butting of heads.  Hard.  Like she wants to make you unconscious with her intellectual power.  Katrina could also conquer the world, so we are working very hard to make sure she is a well-adjusted young woman who seeks to do good things.  Otherwise, we all better get out of here.</p>

<h3>Failure: Grades</h3>

<p>I mentioned I had no problem with grades at Caltech.  That is because I never cared much at all about grades at Caltech.  Somehow I realized my freshman year that to just survive Caltech I had to change to a new grade system.  And so I came up with this: An ‘F’ is an ‘F’, anything higher is a ‘P’, except an ‘A’ is an ‘A’.  That might sound insane, but only by that insanity could I have possibly graduated from Caltech.  But even more, I have indirect empirical data that this was the correct grade system.  Any other grade system (but one) was insane.</p>

<p>As we approached graduation, say Junior year, we started having various meetings sponsored by the Gnome club.  The Gnome club is Caltech’s alumni club, and the meetings were post-graduation oriented.  Basically about getting jobs if you were not going down the academic doctorate path.</p>

<p>The Gnomes had surveyed Caltech alumni over the years to figure out how well they were doing.  I believe they thought they had pretty good data, and being Caltech alumni, they new the standards they were supposed to always exceed, so I will trust them in their observations.  They noticed one very interesting thing about Caltech graduates.  Unlike what people might expect, and maybe unlike the case at other universities, there was absolutely no statistical correlation between final GPA and pretty much anything.  Life earnings… nope.  Happiness… nope.</p>

<p>There was only one variable that affected those things.  Graduating.  Those who flamed out earned less.  So you just had to graduate to get your reward.  Every class you pass gets you closer to graduating.  Each ‘P’ in freshman year, and each ‘Not F’ every year thereafter.  The only other correct grade system is to drop my “an ‘A’ is an ‘A’”.  That would be the simplest correct grade system.  I kept the ‘A’s because I was proud of the ‘A’s.  They were usually in things I loved, or because I really worked my ass off.  So they may not have helped my life earnings, but they did help my happiness.  They reinforced my passions.</p>

<h3>Slumlords</h3>

<p>You aren’t intrinsically a “slumlord” by owning a slummy kind of house in Palo Alto.  The houses aren’t that bad to intrinsically be a slum, so the landlord has to <em>behave</em> like a slumlord to be a slumlord.  Although we have been in Palo Alto for many years, we have had only one slumlord so far.</p>

<p>Luckily, we are relatively immune to most of the negative aspects of slumlords.</p>

<p>We replaced a 1950s stove with something a bit more current.  A noisy and ineffective dishwasher, with something very quiet.  An energy-guzzling old refrigerator with a reasonably green one.  All the showerheads became both water-saving and more effective.  We removed all the drapes in the house because they were ratty and disgusting.  Everything we did was reversible.  The items we removed were placed into storage above and in front of the strange drop-in room in the garage.  Things like the refrigerator were put in the garage too, in case the slumlords were going to be unreasonable on the value of the new one.</p>

<p>For many years, I was not sure if our landlords were slumlords.  Maybe they just had exceedingly bad taste?  Supposedly they had lived in this house for at a few months, lived in the squalor, so squalor was natural to them.  When we suggested that the house needed to be painted before we moved in, they seemed to think that quite novel.  Walls as grimy as the curtains just made sense.  Having clean white walls was novel.  The painter we hired did a great job, and the house looked and worked a lot better after we transformed it.  We had beaten back the power of the slumlords by simply “owning” the house.  I think other tenants would not have enough gumption to do that and would have been at the slumlords mercy.  Or they would simply move out after they realized what was going on.</p>

<h3>Salary: Exposure</h3>

<p>So it is apparent why companies have a disincentive to expose salaries: they may be paying people arbitrarily or unfairly, and that would cause employees to be unsatisfied and either ask for salary adjustments or cause them to quit.  But is there an incentive on the employee part to “keep quiet” about their salary?</p>

<p>I think clearly culturally there is: people who get paid “too much” may not want others to know, and people who get paid “too little” may similarly not want others to know that either.  Basically people are embarrassed about themselves.   And when I say people, I primarily mean men.  Men primarily define the rules of the work force.  Men have been running the working world for quite some time, and although women are now impacting it, there is little chance that they have dramatically changed the rules.</p>

<p>So men don’t want other men to see their salary.  Most men don’t want direct exposure of “what I am worth” for the entire world to see.  They want to hide it.  Men try to hide everything they can be evaluated on, and then deny the rest really matter.</p>

<p>I think women think differently.  Women are already heavily evaluated on very exposed traits.  You can see their beautiful faces and beautiful bodies, and decide “wow” or “no”.  I was getting coffee at Zoom Caffe and one of the patrons was a “Bikini Bodybuilder”.  She had recently started to compete, and remarked that it was a little difficult to have spectators closely staring at her body.  At first.  But she got used to it.  Even draped with loose fitting clothes, it was clear she had an amazingly beautiful body.  She worked on it, and she earned it.  Today she was going to splurge on a Soy Latte.  After this, for the next few weeks leading to the next competition, it was only espresso for her.</p>

<p>After my tenth startup, I was quite fat.  The stress and time commitment of startups had caused me to “let it go” in ways that seriously affected my waistline and health.  Fortunately Katrina asked me to teach her how to play tennis.  I had enough time, and enough commitment that her simple request caused me to lose 40 pounds of fat, and gain 10 pounds of muscle.  I am no longer fat.</p>

<p>When I went to buy a suit, so I could testify in court or blend in with my East Coast counterparts, I inquired about made-to-measure suits.  MTMs cost about 20% more if the same material.  You can also get some materials for MTMs that you can’t get off the rack.  I picked one beautiful material, and it priced out at $33K!  I decided to not wear a car.  And I also decided not to go the MTM route.  I wear a 40R, and off the rack a 40R fit me perfectly.  Or really, I fit a 40R perfectly.  I was not fat or skinny.  Through efforts during the prior year, I was “built”.  So if we got the shoulders right, and hemmed the pants, everything else pretty much fell into place.</p>

<p>When talking to the tailors and sales people, they remarked how good I looked in the suit with minimal alterations, and remarked about other customers who would complain that the tailor was doing a bad job of making them look good in their suits.  They paid several thousand dollars for a suit, and expected it would look good on them.  But their waste was in the 40s or 50s.  The tailor had no hope.  The customer was exposed because you just cannot hide certain things.</p>

<p>I mentally calculated what it “cost me” to transform my ‘quite fat’ body into the ‘no longer fat’ body.  I get paid hourly when not in startups, so this is pretty simple math.  In most places other than Palo Alto, I am wearing a nice house.  And I am proud of it.  I earned it.</p>

<h3>Stock: Dissent</h3>

<p>About a year after I left Evant, they were successfully sold to Manhattan Associates.  The sale was not at a very good price, and by this point there were Series-C and Series-B shares along with the Series-A and Common.  Startup stocks have two very simple core rules: “Preferred gets money before Common”, and “Last in, First out”.  You can have various other rules too based on the actual preferences in a preferred stock, but these rarely affect the core rules.  The sale price was so low that Common was wiped out.  This is actually “common” if unfortunate.  People with common stock did not put any money in, so if it is a down sale, there is no reason for them to expect to get money at all.  All the preferred shares put money in, and can reasonably expect to get their money back if at all possible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the sale price was so low that Series-A was going to get nothing too.  I believe that is less common, but it clearly possible.  The price was such that Series-C was going to get its money back (actually more than that, based on a preference), and Series-B was going to get its money back.  But Series-A was going to get nothing.  I was not amused.  I had received Series-A stock in lieu of cash owed to me, and I wanted <em>my money</em> back.  I was being a nice guy to let them give me stock at the time, but I am not a pushover.  So when I received a letter stating, “you will get nothing”, I was very angry.  I understood the supposed core rules, but felt that the “Last in, First out” was unfair.  We all put money in.  Evant put my money in without me even wanting it to.  So we should all get a portion relative to the amount of money we put in.</p>

<p>As a CEO, you can’t actually just unilaterally sell a company.  You have to get the investors to agree.  How many investors?  Well, it used to be all investors.  Unanimous agreement.  So my anger could have simply killed the acquisition.  Evant would have been dead in the water because they couldn’t convince me to agree to do something for “less than nothing”.  Historically this turned out to be problematic.  So states changed the rules and made sales possible with majorities.  But in exchange they enable investors to “dissent”.  A dissenting investor will not block the sale, but will be able to get their money back because they don’t want to participate in the sale.  They don’t want to be part of the new company.</p>

<p>So I wrote the people in charge a poignant email, and calculated what portion of the proceeds I should get given my percentage of investment dollar.  Who ever I was talking with, wrote back and said something like “That isn’t going to happen!”  We may have conversed a few more times with me clearly stating I was not going to agree to the sale, that I was dissenting, and that the law is pretty obvious on this.  I believe the other side kept saying nothing was going to happen.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, an envelope comes from Manhattan Associates to me.  Inside it there is no letter or any form of explanation.  But there is a check.  A nicely sized check.  I deposited it that day.</p>

<h3>Failure: Rinse and Repeat</h3>

<p>The VLSI course story doesn’t end where I left it.</p>

<p>The next year, I am somehow taking the same course <em>again</em>.  I actually don’t recall whether I dropped it the year before or I just decided to take it again.  The first sounds more likely, and this year I am with my classmate (the year before I was ‘young’).  Same contest.  Likely a different circuit.  Put in a ridiculous number of hours.  And reviewed my design very carefully.  We may have been able to simulate this year (tools were improving year-by-year).  If we could, I definitely did.  Before the homework submission I ask the professor for help (like a sanity check), but he says no.</p>

<p>We all submit our homework, and the professor or TAs review them all.  The next class, the professor shows the outline of all the different solutions.  Basically bunches of squares and rectangles inside one another with the smallest in the center.  This time I know exactly what this diagram shows.</p>

<p>I recognize my outline because it is slightly distinct this year.  Like an ‘L’ maybe.</p>

<p>It is in the center.</p>

<p>It is not bold.</p>

<p>I pass the course this time.  I never take any other courses from that professor.  Still love VLSI.</p>

<h3>Car: The 110</h3>

<p>So our food caravan had at least two cars, and we would head out into the world of LA every few nights.  At the time, the 210 freeway was relatively new and very little had been built along its corridor.  So most of the city was either straight south of Pasadena or more likely somehow related to the heart of LA itself.  To get to the heart of LA from Pasadena, you take the 110.  It is called a freeway on the map, but it is not.  It is a raceway.</p>

<p>The 110 runs along the Arroyo Seco riverbed.  There might be water in there, but I am not sure I ever saw any.  Properly named.  The important things about the 110 are: it is shaped like a river, it has three lanes, and it has stop-signs for onramps.  LA roads in general have many more lanes than I experienced growing up.  The big road into Philadelphia (the Schuykill Expressway) had only two lanes.  Even crossing the country, having more than two lanes was uncommon.  But LA roads like the 10 could have four or more.   The 110 had the perfect number of lanes.  Three lanes.  Enough to avoid Parcheesi.  Enough to dodge either right or left.  The proper number of lanes for a racetrack.</p>

<p>The 110 starts in Pasadena, so getting onto it from there is no problem.  But all the other onramps are basically a stop-sign.  You need to go from zero to sixty in ideally one second, but cars then and now don’t work that way.  So the racetrack frequently lost its right-most lane because some ten-second acceleration was occurring in the right lane.  This was a feature of the racetrack.  Like in a video game where part of the track shoot flames at you.</p>

<p>Parcheesi in racing is where two (idiot) cars travel at exactly the same speed right next to each other.  It is amongst the worse sins in car driving.  Either go faster, or go slower, or simply go behind the other car.  All of these provide space for people going much faster than you to get through.  Having three lanes made the 110 relatively immune to Parcheesi.  Having the stop-sign onramps made it completely inoculated.</p>

<p>So to race on the 110 you are primarily choosing between the left lane (the proper fast lane), and the right lane.  Normal traffic is in the middle lane.  While twisting back and forth with the riverbed, you are constantly looking at the right lane to figure out if it is the faster lane for this brief moment.  Is it worth the double lane switch?</p>

<p>It was a blast.</p>

<h3>Car: Fast and Steady</h3>

<p>There is a phrase “Slow and steady wins the race”.  This is a lie.  Fast and steady win races.  Fast and steady with a breakaway in the home stretch.  Just watch California Chrome.</p>

<p>The two best cars in our Caltech food caravan were my 1982 Toyota Celica and a 1982 Audi Quattro.  The Quattro gets its name from having four-wheel drive.  It had a better engine, better transmission, and better suspension than my Celica.  It was a superior race vehicle.</p>

<p>The initial 110 raceway runs against the Quattro proved how much better the Quattro and it’s driver were.  You can make a lot of mistakes on the 110: going right and being trapped by a stop-sign car.  Going left and being Parcheesied.   The Quattro was able to recover from these very easily.  So all the initial runs on the 110 went to it, because it was clearly superior.</p>

<p>Driving fast on LA freeways, including the 110, is all about steadiness.  Yes, if you have a Maserati, you can pretend you are driving fast just about any way you like.  But “you” are not driving fast, your car is fast.  And it is common to see fast Maserati’s that are trapped because of an idiotically slow driver.</p>

<p>LA freeways have many lanes filled with cars driving at all kinds of different speeds.  At any time of day where racing is possible, the lanes themselves tend to have relatively consistent speeds (say 70 MPH for the left lane), and they also have spaces.  Some are large spaces, where a car is very much ahead of the trailing car.  Some are small spaces, even just a one second rule at 70MPH produces 50 feet of space.  To drive fast in LA, you wander the spaces.  Ideally wandering the least amount, but wandering is better than accelerating and braking.  If you get good at wandering, you don’t brake at all.  You fly.</p>

<p>For about six months the Quattro punished my poor Celica and me.  But eventually I learned to fly.  And the better engine, transmission, and suspension of the Quattro were meaningless.  The ‘quattro’ was meaningless.  We weren’t in the desert, but on LA freeways.  And both cars were flying.  Wins were a toss-up.</p>
