##What does the fox say?  The Supersonic Fox say?

This is a site about programming.  About leaving tennis for 30 years and then, one summer, starting it back up again.  That was last summer, and less than a year later I now play like Federer.  I am not 100% of a Federer [^1], but if you watch me play, the similarities are there.  And they are there on purpose.
[^1]: An important new unit-of-measure in tennis


This site will describe how I transformed myself, a bit short of my 50th birthday, into a player better than my 18 year old self.
In one year.  With lots of help, some important equipment, and a lot of "professional learning".  And an insane amount of fun.

Tennis is insanely fun to me now, and whatever level you are, it can be insanely fun for you too.  If you want to get better while you have fun, I and some coauthors may be able to help.

Oh, and if you are curious about the name.  My father was a great tennis player who played a very strategic "touch" game.
When he was about my age they started to call him the gray fox.  I am his son, so I am also a fox.
But I don't want a primarily touch game.  I want 100+ mph serves and ground strokes.
I am happy to be a fox, but I want to move and hit at supersonic speeds: a supersonic fox.  What does the supersonic fox say?  If you keep reading, you will find out! :-)

Oh, and sponsor your local tennis shop!  In Palo Alto, try http://tennistownandcountry.com and tell them Mark (or the SuperSonicFox) sent you :-)

And if you live in the area and want to play more, see http://tennispaloalto.com/ and we will find a court, time, and nice players to play with you.

Oh, and I have a book <a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">The Slums of Palo Alto</a> which despite its
title has some significant insights into playing tennis.
