  <div class="entry-content"><p>After I wrote the first version of <a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">http://slumsofpaloalto.com/</a> (the MVB), my aunt sent me a very interesting article.
It was about &lsquo;Focus&rsquo; and two mildly successful people: Bill Gates and Warren Buffet.  You can read it <a href="http://qz.com/231907/why-bill-gates-and-warren-buffett-are-so-successful-in-one-word/">Here</a>.</p>

<p>Accidentally, this posting will do the same thing with the word &lsquo;Progress&rsquo;.  &lsquo;Progress&rsquo; is both <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Progress+definition">a verb and a noun</a>.
And for you to succeed with the noun &ldquo;Make progress&rdquo;, you must succeed with the verb &ldquo;Progress&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And what are you going to progress through?
Failing of course (see <a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">my book</a> for lots more info about success through failing)!
You don&rsquo;t want to avoid failing, you want to fail a lot.  And then progress through it so you can start failing
at something else.  Day after day, fail after fail, onward to Wimbledon.  Seriously.</p>

<p>And you can leverage your incredible advantage over Federer and Nadal: I doubt you make any money from tennis, so winning
shouldn&rsquo;t really be at all important to your livelihood.  And more radically: it shouldn&rsquo;t be at all important to you, PERIOD!</p>

<p>If you want to be great, you will happily lose pretty much <em>all the time</em>.  You won&rsquo;t be throwing the match.  That is silly.
You will constantly <em>play your best</em>.</p>

<p>So why are you losing?  Or to change pronoun.  Why am I always losing?  For more than a year, I have played tennis and almost
always lost my serve.  I consider it almost bizarre to win my serve.  I do commonly win matches now because certain parts of
my game are so good that they really don&rsquo;t fail.  If I am not serving every other game (i.e. playing Doubles), I actually do win a
fair amount now.  But it is effectively <em>in spite</em> of me failing so much.</p>

<p>Finally, the punch-line.  I fail so much because I am always practicing <em>my best game</em> and this is also commonly <em>totally new and
difficult</em>.  For nine months I tried to serve like Federer.  Failed a lot.  By month nine, I had a decent 90 MPH serve.  Not
totally reliable, but definitely decent.  So I had progressed from being a 3-ish kind of player to being a 4-ish kind of player.
Definitely &lsquo;made progress&rsquo;.  Awesome right?!</p>

<p>A week later, my serve was notably &ldquo;less winning&rdquo; (you might call it &lsquo;worse&rsquo; but that would be incorrect).
I could barely keep it in the court.  I could barely land my feet properly.  And this was all John&rsquo;s fault&hellip; and all my
fault.  Lots of fault to blame the faults on ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>What happened?  I was going for a 100MPH serve.  I had a 90, wanted 100.  That required a couple tweaks to my service motion
and it took me a week of practice to get those pieces in play.  When I headed for 120 MPH, my motion was so big that it
took me almost a month of daily practice to get it.  I have it now (the motion if not the 120), and low and behold today
is my day with John.  And he tweaked me again.</p>

<p>So I am constantly failing and losing because I am <em>constantly practicing</em> the strokes I need <em>for Wimbledon</em>.  I may never
go.  I may never make it.  But when I play a game with you, I am treating you like Federer, and playing a game that could
potentially beat Federer.  Or at least the best game I possibly can.  The best game I could ever have given where I am today.</p>

<p>So that is why I fail a lot but also progressed a lot.  Failing to beat Federer is not a particularly bad thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About nine or ten months into my transformation, I was hitting serves and ground-strokes at about 90 MPH.  &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
Yes, really.  You can ask my partners, but more objectively you can ask my Go Pro Hero.  The Go Pro is a
wide angle, 120 FPS, video camera.  It has other abilities too, but for tennis, this particular mode will
be the most important for you.  If you don&rsquo;t have a Go Pro Hero, try to borrow one from someone, or stop
by my courts and I will tape you.</p>

<p>Again, about ten months in, I had video confirming the 90 MPH speeds.  Of course, if I am serving at 90 MPH the
obvious question is &ldquo;How do I serve at 120 MPH?&rdquo;  At least, that is the obvious question to me :&ndash;)</p>

<p>So I asked my coach John, how do I serve at 120 MPH and he told me to do four new things.  One involved holding
my racket looser, which I actually applied to every stroke.  My racket is floppy in my hands now, significantly
aided by a tacky Tourna-Grip wrap.  But the other three things involved my coiling my body in a way that even
this morning caused me to pant.  Just practicing it involves so many muscles in my body that I feel completely
spent every time I do it.  I now serve beyond 100 MPH, and maybe I reach 120 on a good serve.</p>

<p>But this post isn&rsquo;t about that, it is about the other side of a 100 MPH serve.  It is about being incredibly <em>slow</em>
to be that incredibly <em>fast</em>.</p>

<p>In previous posts, I mentioned that you are trying to convince your body that tennis is a critical part of
its survival.  That is definitely true, but at the same time, you are not trying to actually <em>harm</em> your body.
It is on your side.  You need to take care of it.  Very good care.</p>

<p>So wear sunscreen :&ndash;)</p>

<p>But also recognize that your body is probably not innately comfortable traveling at 100 MPH.  To produce a 100 MPH
serve or ground-stroke, your racket has to be traveling at 100 MPH.  Yes, the racket head is a bit further out than
your palm, but not by that much.  So your palm is traveling at basically 100 MPH (say you now hit 120 with your serve)
and your elbow a bit slower, and you shoulder a bit slower, etc.  But to be simple, lets just assume <em>everything</em>
is traveling at about 100 MPH.  That is a lot of speed.  And more importantly, that is <em>a lot of energy</em>.</p>

<p>For me, I feel it mostly in the shoulder.  The rotater cuff is a crazy complicated and impressive set of muscles.
Pitching softball a few years ago, I mangled it a bit, but have apparently recovered since then.  But now in
tennis, I am in constant communication with this set of muscles.  I serve at 100 MPH+ and I am asking these muscles
very politely to <em>keep my arm attached</em>.  I would like the ball to go to the other side of the court and my arm
to stay on this side.  And I recognize this is no small request on my rotater: that arm is traveling nearly 100 MPH
and those shoulder muscles are keep that arm attached.</p>

<p>The next section may seem &ldquo;extreme&rdquo;, and if you are under 25, feel free to do whatever you want with your body.
But remember I warned you :&ndash;)</p>

<p>So back to our bodies.  You need your body to travel at 100 MPH without tearing itself apart right?  You can do this,
but just do it very slowly.  Using serving as an example, my preparation for serving has been getting slower and slower
as my serving has been getting faster and faster.  I can take me 15 to 30 minutes to be ready to serve now, where before
I would just walk up to the line and wail on that ball.</p>

<p>During these 15 to 30 minutes, I:</p>

<ul>
<li> Toss the ball many times, to different &lsquo;quadrants&rsquo; surrounding my body.  If you looked down from about, quadrant &lsquo;1&rsquo; is your front right, &lsquo;2&rsquo; is your front left, and so on.</li>
<li> Do a tai-chi like swinging of my racket as a continuous motion around my body.  If you hit 100 MPH, you need to make sure you don&rsquo;t need to <em>stop</em> the 100 MPH energy.  The flow of your racket should be able to slowly dissipate the 100 MPH.</li>
<li> Alternate tossing the ball and seeing its blur, with swinging the racket and seeing its blur.</li>
<li> Do very lazy serves of just one part of the service motion (say a top-spin &lsquo;helicopter&rsquo;) but by this point my racket is contacting the ball, so my wrist is feeling it.</li>
<li> Practice the three-plus dimensional coil, using the fence to provide resistance and feedback</li>
<li> Start a fuller service motion, but don&rsquo;t take it very seriously</li>
<li> Take it a bit more seriously</li>
<li> Practice hitting balls over the far fence with my &lsquo;A&rsquo; (pure power, most natural flow) serve</li>
<li> Then start working through the actual serves</li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see, the above is not a small list.  By the time I am hitting balls over the far fence, my body is ready for the 100 MPH, but
there are at least six bullets before that.  Those bullets didn&rsquo;t seem very important to me for nine months, but now they are
critical.  I rarely skip any of them, and when I skip some I am trusting that my routine the day before made that skipping
&lsquo;safe&rsquo;.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have exactly the same bullets as I do, but I definitely recommend you figure out what yours are.  My arm
is still attached to me, and I would like yours to be too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Previously I said I could provide nothing to help you determine &ldquo;What should I actually be practicing?&rdquo;  That
was a lie, but it was important to get out of the way: <em>you</em> are responsible for what you should be practicing.
Coaches, friends, random strangers, and so on can suggest things you should be practicing.  They may be right
or wrong (I have had a lot of unsolicited suggestions in the last year, some of which were actually useful),
but you must practice, so it is up to you to decide &lsquo;what&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t have a lot of insight into &lsquo;what&rsquo; you should be practicing, but based on the last year, I do
have one piece of advice: Pick a Model.</p>

<p>Pick some pro in the top 500 of men or women who you want to be like.  Then imagine you play like them.  Start
studying their playing style, look at slow motion of their strokes, imagine that your muscles worked like theirs.
And practice <em>that</em>.  Twelve hours a week (or more&hellip; or less).</p>

<h3>My Model</h3>

<p>I picked Federer.  It was kind of a no-brainer (given his rank), but I picked Federer when he was &lsquo;down&rsquo; and no
longer #1.  The reason I picked Roger Federer is that he played how I wanted to be able to play.  It was as simple
as that.  The second reason I picked Roger is that there was <em>a lot</em> of
high speed film of him.  So there was a lot of information about <em>how</em> he hit the ball from baseline through
serve.  Actually, I couldn&rsquo;t care less how Federer volleys: I have a touch game where my volley is basically innate.
I earned my volley through 18 years of work in my youth, so I don&rsquo;t actually watch or think about it at all (except <em>to think</em>
about it: they hit, I hit, watch ball, hit ball, see it hit your racket, don&rsquo;t look where it is going).</p>

<p>So Roger had the game I wanted, and had the videos of the game I wanted, but the last thing Federer had was something
he <em>didn&rsquo;t have</em>.  Federer has no talent.  That might sound like a slam against him, but it is actually the opposite.
Federer has a game <em>he completely deserves</em>.  He built himself into being able to play that game.  It isn&rsquo;t his
naturally gifted game: I hear he had that too, but that isn&rsquo;t what he plays with.  He has a game that he wanted, created,
and then executed on.  It is a &ldquo;Game Plan&rdquo;, and as long as his &ldquo;no talent&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t totally alien to &ldquo;my body&rdquo;, I can
copy him.</p>

<p>When I left tennis John McEnroe was the icon of tennis.  But McEnroe is the opposite of Federer: he is insanely, innately,
talented.  Or if not, he has created a tennis game that is simply <em>not copyable</em>.  I have seen youth try and fail.
I have seen them try and injure themselves.  Try, try, try, and fail, fail, fail.  Failing is not bad unless
success is impossible.  In my opinion, copying McEnroe is impossible.</p>

<p>But copying Federer is not.  At least one person did it (Federer himself), and the rest of us can do it too&hellip; if you
want.</p>

<h3>Your Model</h3>

<p>You need to pick your model.  Feel free to pick Federer, but feel free to instead pick Serena, Rafeal, or anyone else in the top 500 who
makes you feel awesome.  &ldquo;If I could play like that, I would feel awesome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then start watching them, and start thinking &ldquo;How could I play like that?&rdquo;  &ldquo;What would my strokes look like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now you have the &lsquo;what&rsquo;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So now that you have said &ldquo;hello&rdquo; a few times to your first partner (if not, please go back one blog),
you might be wondering &ldquo;What should I actually be practicing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this blog will not give you specifics on that.  You need to be practicing lots of things.  And
if your partner is a wall, you need to understand how to practice against a wall.  So google these things and
read what USPTA coaches write on the web, or get a USPTA coach to train you on improving your strokes, or go
to a few tennis clinics and see what they say you should work on.  Or if you play at Mitchell and let me watch
you, I (not a USPTA coach) might make suggestions.  Or I will grab my coach (John Chan) to look at you.
But I believe there is nothing I can write on this blog
that will help you with the &lsquo;what&rsquo;.  Sorry.</p>

<p>But if you know the &lsquo;what&rsquo;, I will help you with the &lsquo;how&rsquo;.</p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p>For the moment, I will assume you are playing with your first partner (i.e. a wall), but if not, the &lsquo;how&rsquo; only
changes a bit.  If you are playing against a ball machine, the &lsquo;how&rsquo; changes in ways that help you (because ball machines
are amazing and they don&rsquo;t expect you to return the ball to them).  If you are playing against a human partner (who is not
a ball-feeding-coach), the &lsquo;how&rsquo; is a little more complex because people generally like the ball to go back to them.
But for the moment, I will ignore these nuances and start with your first wall-ish partner.</p>

<h4>Incrementally</h4>

<p>First rule of &lsquo;how&rsquo;: incrementally.  You are working up to a better you!  Or at least a better tennis-playing you!  I transformed
in a year.  But that was just &lsquo;what it took&rsquo;, not what I expected.  And you shouldn&rsquo;t use it as a reference.  You need no
reference: this is a journey.  Maybe lifelong.  I am still working on mine, where next I will go (hah!) to Wimbledon.  I think
big, but I am still working incrementally.  I might be 90 before I get to Wimbledon. :&ndash;)</p>

<p>So don&rsquo;t expect any incredible improvements off the bat.  Try to improve, but all improvements are doing things <em>better</em> than
you do today.  Or if you start something completely different, take it slow.  Assume it will take you 20+ hours to &lsquo;get it&rsquo; at
all.  This will not harm you in making progress, and will make sure you don&rsquo;t get frustrated or <em>injured</em>.</p>

<p>The incrementally applies to both day-to-day, but also within-session.  Any given day, you need to start slow.  If you think
you are so innately good that you can avoid warming up slowly&hellip; then come play against me.  I may be a 5.0 and as I progressed
up that ladder, I got <em>slower</em> and <em>slower</em>.  I am 48, so maybe it is related to my age.  But I believe the <em>slower</em> is mostly related to
how much my body is doing&hellip; how many <em>tiny</em> muscles are working along side <em>huge</em> muscles to produce a 100+ MPH ball.</p>

<p>I was actually very foolish early on, and just barely squeaked by without injuring myself.  Once I took two weeks off because I
pulled a muscle in my back that I had <em>no idea</em> I even had.  It was partially bad form, but it was mostly me pushing to get a 90 MPH
serve a bit too quickly.</p>

<p>So this is a journey you are on every session and every day.  Every session is a journey where you warm up incrementally: slow
 easy strokes to start.  My coach likes beginners to hit ground-strokes to each other within the service box: I think
   it helps you remember or learn how to put top-spin on the ball.  So maybe do the same,
 either with a person or a wall.  And then move further back and do a fuller stroke but no heavy effort or grunting (I make a
 lot of &lsquo;air noise&rsquo; on the court).  And then start picking up the pace.</p>

<p>A final aspect of incremental is that you should <em>review</em> and <em>improve</em> before you learn <em>new</em>.  Make sure your main serve is
working before working on a new serve.  It isn&rsquo;t that your new serve is less important, but your body <em>knows</em> the existing
serve, so make sure it remembers it.</p>

<h4>Consistently</h4>

<p>I believe you need to be at least minimally consistent to your practice.  Don&rsquo;t take weeks off and make up for them later.
Yes, you can go on a vacation for a week, but ideally even then you maintain a minimal level of activity in the sport.
I can&rsquo;t be sure this is truly required (vs. the Incrementally, which I am willing to bet on), and feel free to follow someone
else&rsquo;s advice over mine.  But I have a couple explanations for the consistency that may convince you (or give you a good
arguing point about).</p>

<p>First, if you are consistent about the workout you can be inconsistent (also known as varied) about its content.  About four
months into my transformation, I was now playing against a ball machine vs. a wall to workout.  By consistently having three+
sessions a week, I could make one session have a major focus on returning serves.  Returning serves is a lot of fun for me
(and terrorizes some of my opponents now), but setting up to return serves with a ball machine requires a couple tables, a
ladder, and a fair amount of strength and effort.  That is, it has a high overhead and costs me a bunch of time.  But the
consistency of 3 weekly sessions made me sure I could cover other things with the other two session.</p>

<p>Second, you are trying to convince <em>your body</em> and <em>your mind</em> that Tennis is important to them.
Your body should expect to have to play tennis
several times a week, and it can&rsquo;t slack off and expect you would do the same (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tired&rdquo;).  And if you spend
a late night drinking, your mind can&rsquo;t tell you in the morning to slack off either (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to &lsquo;tired&rsquo;&rdquo;).  No, when
the buzzer goes off, your body and your mind <em>are going to that court</em>.  And after a few weeks of that they both
start towing the line, and the rest of your habits fall into place to match.</p>

<h4>As much as ****ing possible</h4>

<p>The final advice is to figure out how to get to 12+ hours of tennis a week.  Yes, TWELVE HOURS.  You don&rsquo;t have TWELVE HOURS?
Are you <em>sure</em>?  What do you do between 5AM and 7AM everyday?  How many days of the week have a time period between 5AM and 7AM?
If you care about getting better at tennis&hellip; I just found you your TWELVE HOURS, and I will let you do something else with the
spare two hours.</p>

<p>Why twelve?  Because by the time your body and mind hit twelve hours a week, they both realize that tennis is not just important&hellip;
for some reason it is now <em>essential to your survival</em>.  And if they were towing the line to be consistent, they are now standing
at attention and even <em>thinking for you</em> to figure out how to survive this incredibly important tennis-thing.</p>

<p>If you really can&rsquo;t do 12, pick a lesser number <em>that you can&rsquo;t do</em> and then figure out how to do that.  Practice as much as
possible.  No less than 3x the number of lessons you have a week (e.g. 3 hours per 1 hour lesson, and those 3 hours are <em>practice</em>,
not social matches).  With that multiplier you coach will be very happy with you.  My coach (John Chan) get&rsquo;s a 10x multiplier
from me, and we happily train me in 2-3 new good habits every week (crazy slice serve among them this last week).</p>

<h3>Summary of How</h3>

<p>Incrementally, consistently, and as much as possible (12+ hours ideally), with your first partner
or anyone willing to hit with you</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I commonly refer to everyone with whom I play tennis as my &lsquo;partner&rsquo;.  I have no opponents, just partners who are either
on the same side of the net, or partners on the opposite of the net.  This may be because we switch up
the matches quite a bit, or because I appreciate their help when we warm up, or just because I am a friendly guy
who does not really want any opponents.  Whatever the reason, that is what I mean by &lsquo;Partner&rsquo;: someone who plays tennis
with other people.</p>

<p>If you want to get good at tennis, you need to find a good partner.  And however good you are, your first partner
needs to match your abilities as they are today, and how good they will be in a couple months of serious practice (yes, I
said &lsquo;serious practice&rsquo;&hellip; you are serious aren&rsquo;t you?).</p>

<p>That is a tall order for this first partner to fill.  But amazingly, your first partner will be even better than just
this tall order.  Your first partner will be amazingly reliable and incredibly consistent.  If you don&rsquo;t play tennis
today, it was because <em>you</em> chose not to play and get better.  Seven days a week, your partner will be ready.  You might
have to drive a bit to meet up, but that drive or walk is to tennis courts, and given you are a tennis player that
is expected of you.  And you may have to meet up early in the day or your first partner could be busy.</p>

<p>The only real short-coming to your first partner is they don&rsquo;t have much of a personality or ever have much to say.
If you are serious about tennis, you will walk up to your partner 3+ times a week and say &ldquo;hello&rdquo;.  And every time
they will sincerely say nothing back.  Because they are a wall.</p>

<p>The tennis wall is the ultimate starting partner: it is waiting for you right now!  Grab a racket and even just one ball,
head over to the wall, and start hitting.  See!  It was ready and waiting for you!  You can do the same thing every day
at 6AM when it is less busy.  You can even do the same thing at <em>3AM</em> (depending on the wall&rsquo;s &ldquo;community rules&rdquo;)
although it can be a bit difficult to see.  I did this just yesterday (seriously!), so I am quite sure the wall is
there at 3AM and doesn&rsquo;t sneak away to play with other walls.  Or at least it didn&rsquo;t yesterday.</p>

<p>If you want to be good or even great at tennis, you have to find your nearest tennis wall (aka backboard),
introduce yourself, and commit to meeting up with it regularly.  If you miss a meeting, it is <em>your fault</em>.
You didn&rsquo;t care enough about tennis: it was there and waiting for you.  Maybe
you should make up for it by doubling the routine the next week.  The wall loves company, it just has a hard time telling
you so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that my daughter and I had equipment, we needed just a couple more things.  Courts and Time.</p>

<p>We live within walking distance of Mitchell Park in Palo Alto.  Mitchell has amazing tennis courts!  They clean themselves
every day magically.  They are right next to backboards so people can warm up and then join games.  There are a fair number
of them (seven) and within an easy walk there are six more.  And the tennis players at Mitchell are amongst the friendliest
you will ever encounter.  I am happy to now be counted among this elite community and to be expanding its reach every week.</p>

<p>Yes, I have played on <em>better surfaced</em> courts than Mitchell.  Lots of clays are nicer than Mitchell&rsquo;s surface.
And Wimbledon grass might be quite a bit better.  But the self-cleaning and community part is amazing: I have
never encountered anything like it anywhere else.  And these courts are public and <em>free</em>.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/MitchellCourts_CIMG1692_h864.jpg" width="1152" height="864" /></p>

<p>So shortly after my daughter and I bought equipment at <a href="http://tennistownandcountry.com">http://tennistownandcountry.com</a> , we ventured over to the courts at
Mitchell.  My memory is feeble, so I can&rsquo;t say what time of the day it actually was, but let me guess it was maybe 9AM or 10AM.</p>

<p>With seven courts available, finding court time is not particularly difficult.  So after 30 years of hiatus, I was back on the court:
teaching my daughter some basics of tennis, and reminding my body of the moves it needed to do.  That body was now 48 when last it
really played tennis, it was 18.</p>

<p>This first day I had no actual problems for me and my body, but if you know me from my book
(<a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">http://slumsofpaloalto.com/</a>) this was shortly after my <em>tenth</em> startup.  Startups take 60 to 80 hours a week from you every
week.  Or at least that is what they took from me: I was very good, but I had to get a lot done to hope to see any real
payoff.  And with a decade of one-after-the-other startups, I was now fat.  Like 200 pounds kind of fat.  With no significant
amount of muscle to explain that kind of weight.</p>

<p>So although the first day of playing tennis went fine and my daughter and I had a lot of fun, I was well aware this
could go awry very quickly.  Kids can quickly become
seriously good at things they focus on.  And kids have unlimited energy at their disposal.
So if my daughter became even mildly serious about tennis, having 30+ pounds of fat was going to prevent me from keeping up with her.</p>

<p>So a day of play became a start of an incredible journey.  Day by day I &ldquo;simply played&rdquo;, but each of those days of play transformed me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To play tennis, you  need equipment.  I grew up with tennis in the 1970s and 1980s.  By the time I was &ldquo;serious&rdquo; about tennis,
I played with Head Professional aluminum rackets.  I loved them: indestructible unless you were ridiculously mad at the court.  Until
2013, &ldquo;Red Heads&rdquo; were my only kind of racket:  Tiny, stiff, and indestructible.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/CIMG2413_w864.jpg" width="864" height="1152" /></p>

<p>Over the decades of absence, I gave all my tennis equipment away.  So in the summer of 2013, when my daughter Katrina decided she wanted to
play, I had to buy new equipment.  There is only one right place to by tennis equipment.  A tennis shop.  No, don&rsquo;t go online.  No, don&rsquo;t go
to Sports Authority (feel free to go there for other things).  You buy tennis equipment from a &ldquo;Pro&rdquo;: from someone that is at least a 4.x
and who can talk to you about your game.  That is if you want to be good.  If not, just go to a flea market.</p>

<p>My nearest Tennis Shop is Tennis Town and Country <a href="http://tennistownandcountry.com">http://tennistownandcountry.com</a> . Over the year I transformed, I may have spent 100 hours in the shop.
But that first hour with Caden and Todor was critical: What racket should my daughter get?  And what racket should I get?  And finally, what balls should
we play with?</p>

<p>It may not have been critical that we get all this perfect the first time, but a year later I play with exactly the same racket.  Actually <em>five</em> of them.
And after a year of growth physically and in skill, my daughter gave me her racket as a targeting racket<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.  So as far as I can tell, Todor and Caden
completely nailed it.
My daughter played for a year with a Wilson Roger Federer 24&#8221;, and my racket collection started with a Head Speed MP.  My grip is slightly small for me, but
that is because I put Tourna Grip tape on it, which adds another 1/8th maybe.  I have changed lots of different things about my game, my grip, my strings,
and lots of other equipment.  But through a year of changes, I still play with the Head Speed MP.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/CIMG2414_w864.jpg" width="864" height="1152" /></p>

<p>Why?  Because it is an awesome racket!!!  And it is still better than I am, even as I wander into the 5.x-ish territory.  I did one day play with a Babolet
Pure Strike 18x20.  I admit that is also an awesome racket!!!  Actually it felt like I imagine smoking crack might feel like.  I had such insane amounts of
control that I felt I was fiddling with millimeters.  But I thought the drug too strong and didn&rsquo;t want to swap out my five rackets.  And then Head came out
 with Lynx strings, which was a good fraction of the same drug.</p>

<p>So in one hour we had the two rackets we needed for the courts.  I also bought some Slazenger Wimbledon balls, and although I am <em>capable</em> of playing with
other balls, over the year I would purchase dozens of cans of only this one kind of ball.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/CIMG2415_h864.jpg" width="1152" height="864" /></p>

<p>So we have rackets and balls, what else do we need?</p>

<p>The only right answer is <em>nothing</em>.  <em>Yet</em>.  No giant bag for rackets you don&rsquo;t have.  No fancy Fila&rsquo;s that feel as light as the air.  No tennis shoes.
You don&rsquo;t need any of that the first day.</p>

<p>But feel free to buy it: it supports the tennis shop and you could definitely have an awesome wardrobe.  Especially try out the biking shirts which will help women
carry tennis balls (at all) and people who need to practice their serve (i.e. everyone) can carry six to ten balls at a time and do away with the
ball hopper.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been writing a book <a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">http://slumsofpaloalto.com/</a> and playing a lot of tennis.  The tennis was a major part of
how I transformed in the last year, and may have been a major enabler for writing the book.  Losing 40 pounds of fat, gaining 10+ of muscle,
and having an insanely fun &amp; social activity may have been major catalysts for my transformation.  The book will cover some of what
happened with tennis, but it has a lot of topics in it, and it is mostly about learning &amp; kindness repeatedly being applied after
repeated failures.  This site and blog will focus just on tennis, hoping to help others be better players, and told from
a somewhat elderly, not super-fit (at the start), but definitely committed player.  Not a professional tennis player, but a professional <em>learner</em> who
applied those skills to tennis.</p>

<p>I hope it helps someone else have a little better (or a lot better) of a game, while still having an insanely fun time playing.</p>
