<div class="entry-content"><p>After I wrote the first version of <a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">http://slumsofpaloalto.com/</a> (the MVB), my aunt sent me a very interesting article.
It was about &lsquo;Focus&rsquo; and two mildly successful people: Bill Gates and Warren Buffet.  You can read it <a href="http://qz.com/231907/why-bill-gates-and-warren-buffett-are-so-successful-in-one-word/">Here</a>.</p>

<p>Accidentally, this posting will do the same thing with the word &lsquo;Progress&rsquo;.  &lsquo;Progress&rsquo; is both <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Progress+definition">a verb and a noun</a>.
And for you to succeed with the noun &ldquo;Make progress&rdquo;, you must succeed with the verb &ldquo;Progress&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And what are you going to progress through?
Failing of course (see <a href="http://slumsofpaloalto.com/">my book</a> for lots more info about success through failing)!
You don&rsquo;t want to avoid failing, you want to fail a lot.  And then progress through it so you can start failing
at something else.  Day after day, fail after fail, onward to Wimbledon.  Seriously.</p>

<p>And you can leverage your incredible advantage over Federer and Nadal: I doubt you make any money from tennis, so winning
shouldn&rsquo;t really be at all important to your livelihood.  And more radically: it shouldn&rsquo;t be at all important to you, PERIOD!</p>

<p>If you want to be great, you will happily lose pretty much <em>all the time</em>.  You won&rsquo;t be throwing the match.  That is silly.
You will constantly <em>play your best</em>.</p>

<p>So why are you losing?  Or to change pronoun.  Why am I always losing?  For more than a year, I have played tennis and almost
always lost my serve.  I consider it almost bizarre to win my serve.  I do commonly win matches now because certain parts of
my game are so good that they really don&rsquo;t fail.  If I am not serving every other game (i.e. playing Doubles), I actually do win a
fair amount now.  But it is effectively <em>in spite</em> of me failing so much.</p>

<p>Finally, the punch-line.  I fail so much because I am always practicing <em>my best game</em> and this is also commonly <em>totally new and
difficult</em>.  For nine months I tried to serve like Federer.  Failed a lot.  By month nine, I had a decent 90 MPH serve.  Not
totally reliable, but definitely decent.  So I had progressed from being a 3-ish kind of player to being a 4-ish kind of player.
Definitely &lsquo;made progress&rsquo;.  Awesome right?!</p>

<p>A week later, my serve was notably &ldquo;less winning&rdquo; (you might call it &lsquo;worse&rsquo; but that would be incorrect).
I could barely keep it in the court.  I could barely land my feet properly.  And this was all John&rsquo;s fault&hellip; and all my
fault.  Lots of fault to blame the faults on ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>What happened?  I was going for a 100MPH serve.  I had a 90, wanted 100.  That required a couple tweaks to my service motion
and it took me a week of practice to get those pieces in play.  When I headed for 120 MPH, my motion was so big that it
took me almost a month of daily practice to get it.  I have it now (the motion if not the 120), and low and behold today
is my day with John.  And he tweaked me again.</p>

<p>So I am constantly failing and losing because I am <em>constantly practicing</em> the strokes I need <em>for Wimbledon</em>.  I may never
go.  I may never make it.  But when I play a game with you, I am treating you like Federer, and playing a game that could
potentially beat Federer.  Or at least the best game I possibly can.  The best game I could ever have given where I am today.</p>

<p>So that is why I fail a lot but also progressed a lot.  Failing to beat Federer is not a particularly bad thing.</p>
