<div class="entry-content"><p>So now that you have said &ldquo;hello&rdquo; a few times to your first partner (if not, please go back one blog),
you might be wondering &ldquo;What should I actually be practicing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this blog will not give you specifics on that.  You need to be practicing lots of things.  And
if your partner is a wall, you need to understand how to practice against a wall.  So google these things and
read what USPTA coaches write on the web, or get a USPTA coach to train you on improving your strokes, or go
to a few tennis clinics and see what they say you should work on.  Or if you play at Mitchell and let me watch
you, I (not a USPTA coach) might make suggestions.  Or I will grab my coach (John Chan) to look at you.
But I believe there is nothing I can write on this blog
that will help you with the &lsquo;what&rsquo;.  Sorry.</p>

<p>But if you know the &lsquo;what&rsquo;, I will help you with the &lsquo;how&rsquo;.</p>

<h3>How</h3>

<p>For the moment, I will assume you are playing with your first partner (i.e. a wall), but if not, the &lsquo;how&rsquo; only
changes a bit.  If you are playing against a ball machine, the &lsquo;how&rsquo; changes in ways that help you (because ball machines
are amazing and they don&rsquo;t expect you to return the ball to them).  If you are playing against a human partner (who is not
a ball-feeding-coach), the &lsquo;how&rsquo; is a little more complex because people generally like the ball to go back to them.
But for the moment, I will ignore these nuances and start with your first wall-ish partner.</p>

<h4>Incrementally</h4>

<p>First rule of &lsquo;how&rsquo;: incrementally.  You are working up to a better you!  Or at least a better tennis-playing you!  I transformed
in a year.  But that was just &lsquo;what it took&rsquo;, not what I expected.  And you shouldn&rsquo;t use it as a reference.  You need no
reference: this is a journey.  Maybe lifelong.  I am still working on mine, where next I will go (hah!) to Wimbledon.  I think
big, but I am still working incrementally.  I might be 90 before I get to Wimbledon. :&ndash;)</p>

<p>So don&rsquo;t expect any incredible improvements off the bat.  Try to improve, but all improvements are doing things <em>better</em> than
you do today.  Or if you start something completely different, take it slow.  Assume it will take you 20+ hours to &lsquo;get it&rsquo; at
all.  This will not harm you in making progress, and will make sure you don&rsquo;t get frustrated or <em>injured</em>.</p>

<p>The incrementally applies to both day-to-day, but also within-session.  Any given day, you need to start slow.  If you think
you are so innately good that you can avoid warming up slowly&hellip; then come play against me.  I may be a 5.0 and as I progressed
up that ladder, I got <em>slower</em> and <em>slower</em>.  I am 48, so maybe it is related to my age.  But I believe the <em>slower</em> is mostly related to
how much my body is doing&hellip; how many <em>tiny</em> muscles are working along side <em>huge</em> muscles to produce a 100+ MPH ball.</p>

<p>I was actually very foolish early on, and just barely squeaked by without injuring myself.  Once I took two weeks off because I
pulled a muscle in my back that I had <em>no idea</em> I even had.  It was partially bad form, but it was mostly me pushing to get a 90 MPH
serve a bit too quickly.</p>

<p>So this is a journey you are on every session and every day.  Every session is a journey where you warm up incrementally: slow
 easy strokes to start.  My coach likes beginners to hit ground-strokes to each other within the service box: I think
   it helps you remember or learn how to put top-spin on the ball.  So maybe do the same,
 either with a person or a wall.  And then move further back and do a fuller stroke but no heavy effort or grunting (I make a
 lot of &lsquo;air noise&rsquo; on the court).  And then start picking up the pace.</p>

<p>A final aspect of incremental is that you should <em>review</em> and <em>improve</em> before you learn <em>new</em>.  Make sure your main serve is
working before working on a new serve.  It isn&rsquo;t that your new serve is less important, but your body <em>knows</em> the existing
serve, so make sure it remembers it.</p>

<h4>Consistently</h4>

<p>I believe you need to be at least minimally consistent to your practice.  Don&rsquo;t take weeks off and make up for them later.
Yes, you can go on a vacation for a week, but ideally even then you maintain a minimal level of activity in the sport.
I can&rsquo;t be sure this is truly required (vs. the Incrementally, which I am willing to bet on), and feel free to follow someone
else&rsquo;s advice over mine.  But I have a couple explanations for the consistency that may convince you (or give you a good
arguing point about).</p>

<p>First, if you are consistent about the workout you can be inconsistent (also known as varied) about its content.  About four
months into my transformation, I was now playing against a ball machine vs. a wall to workout.  By consistently having three+
sessions a week, I could make one session have a major focus on returning serves.  Returning serves is a lot of fun for me
(and terrorizes some of my opponents now), but setting up to return serves with a ball machine requires a couple tables, a
ladder, and a fair amount of strength and effort.  That is, it has a high overhead and costs me a bunch of time.  But the
consistency of 3 weekly sessions made me sure I could cover other things with the other two session.</p>

<p>Second, you are trying to convince <em>your body</em> and <em>your mind</em> that Tennis is important to them.
Your body should expect to have to play tennis
several times a week, and it can&rsquo;t slack off and expect you would do the same (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tired&rdquo;).  And if you spend
a late night drinking, your mind can&rsquo;t tell you in the morning to slack off either (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to &lsquo;tired&rsquo;&rdquo;).  No, when
the buzzer goes off, your body and your mind <em>are going to that court</em>.  And after a few weeks of that they both
start towing the line, and the rest of your habits fall into place to match.</p>

<h4>As much as ****ing possible</h4>

<p>The final advice is to figure out how to get to 12+ hours of tennis a week.  Yes, TWELVE HOURS.  You don&rsquo;t have TWELVE HOURS?
Are you <em>sure</em>?  What do you do between 5AM and 7AM everyday?  How many days of the week have a time period between 5AM and 7AM?
If you care about getting better at tennis&hellip; I just found you your TWELVE HOURS, and I will let you do something else with the
spare two hours.</p>

<p>Why twelve?  Because by the time your body and mind hit twelve hours a week, they both realize that tennis is not just important&hellip;
for some reason it is now <em>essential to your survival</em>.  And if they were towing the line to be consistent, they are now standing
at attention and even <em>thinking for you</em> to figure out how to survive this incredibly important tennis-thing.</p>

<p>If you really can&rsquo;t do 12, pick a lesser number <em>that you can&rsquo;t do</em> and then figure out how to do that.  Practice as much as
possible.  No less than 3x the number of lessons you have a week (e.g. 3 hours per 1 hour lesson, and those 3 hours are <em>practice</em>,
not social matches).  With that multiplier you coach will be very happy with you.  My coach (John Chan) get&rsquo;s a 10x multiplier
from me, and we happily train me in 2-3 new good habits every week (crazy slice serve among them this last week).</p>

<h3>Summary of How</h3>

<p>Incrementally, consistently, and as much as possible (12+ hours ideally), with your first partner
or anyone willing to hit with you</p>
