  <h3>Koi</h3>

<p>Koi are beautiful, large, goldfish.  Koi means “carp” in Japanese, and it is also a homophone with another word that means “love”.  Rebecca, Maya, and Katrina are my Koi.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my Koi live in an aquarium that has an open drain.  It is a beautiful aquarium with many wonderful things in it.  Especially the food is amazing, and the fish schools exceptional.  Only the ornamental house is a bit run down.  And my Koi are beautiful, healthy, and happy fish.  The water is always fresh and clean, because dirty water pours out the drain.  Replenishing fresh water gets poured in the top, every month.  Usually.</p>

<p>How we came to be in The Slums of Palo Alto is a progression of our Slumlord raising the rent repeatedly, so the drain became bigger and bigger.  The drain was a reasonable size when we first moved into Palo Alto.  But the relentless rent increases meant more and more gallons of water would pour out the drain every month.  This was problem one.</p>

<p>Problem two was that I did my own startup (Velidom), which drained our cash reserves severely.  There was a point where Velidom was clearly failing but I still needed to pay employees and other company expenses.  Our family’s reserves were all but flushed away.</p>

<p>These experiences then lead to problem three: After Velidom, I did a series of startups to try to get better as the engineering execution side.  Most of these startups behaved reasonably and lawfully towards employees.  We would negotiate a salary, which would be less than what I wanted but “survivable”.  And we would negotiate a stock percentage, which would ultimately be irrelevant because the stock was destined to be worthless.  As the rent kept increasing, the startup salaries became less clearly survivable.  But I somehow managed to string them all together and keep the aquarium running fairly well.  There was a huge toll on me, but generally the younger Koi had no idea.</p>

<p>Then we get to a “not nice” startup.  With this startup, I had an employment agreement that gave me about 10 gallons a month after taxes.  This was very low (lowest ever actually), but the charter of the company and the possibility of helping others excited me.  The aquarium was draining 10 gallons a month normally, but sometimes more like 12.  This was not an ideal situation, but draining a net extra gallon a month is not catastrophic.  And maybe the startup has potential, will get better funded, and I can renegotiate up to 12 or 14 gallons a month.</p>

<p>Then the “not nice” kicks in.  About a year in, suddenly my paystub is half what it was.  I believe there was some mention of cash-flow issues, which I have some empathy for, but employees are supposed to be protected from these kinds of issues.  You would think the employer would just lay me off, but the issue with the smallest stages of startups is some people are not optional.</p>

<p>I ran <em>all</em> of the production systems.  Even more, all these systems were all run on my accounts.  My credit card was being billed.  I am <em>the only one</em> who could maintain them.  I had written <em>all the software</em> that customers were paying to use.  The company could not afford any more software developers.  They basically couldn’t afford me.  I was later to find out that they had only enough money to fund my four-year employment contract for exactly one year.  And had no intention of putting any more money in.  So when they ran out of money, they couldn’t fire me.  But they could ‘short’ me.  And that is what they did.</p>

<p>So back to my poor Koi.  The aquarium is draining at 10 gallons a month, and I am filling it at 5 gallons a month.  This is a serious problem.  You could say I should move to a different aquarium, but this is mid-school-year when this happens.  Changing aquariums would be difficult (new aquariums open up in the summer), and we can’t legally leave Palo Alto while the kids are in school here.  Further, changing aquariums loses a lot of water.  You have to rent the new aquarium, which has its own open drain.  And then moving the Koi to the new aquarium causes more gallons to spill into someone else’s aquarium.  So moving was not really an option.</p>

<p>I had to figure out how to get more water.  My only resources were my particular skills, and the fact that no startup that is shorting you can expect you to work 80 hours a week.  So I now had 40 hours a week to save my Koi.</p>

<h3>Employees: California Labor Commissioner</h3>

<p>I know the facts at the end of the Koi story in vivid detail because of a very funny story.  Several years after working for the startup in Koi, I get an email from the angel investors.  They ultimately did invest in the startup, and although the last three years did not go great, they want to give the company another go with a new CEO.  To do that, all the existing creditors and investors (including people with worthless common, like me) need to sign a contract stating that creditors get nothing (I guess) and investors get one hundredth of what they have now.  So if I owned 2% of the worthless company, I would now own 0.02% of the worthless company.</p>

<p>Legally, for a contract to be valid it must have mutual consideration: both parties must benefit from the contract.  Any one-way contract is not enforceable.  A detrimental contract (one party is hurt in exchange for another’s benefit) is not enforceable.  And forcing someone to take less in consideration after they fulfill their side of the contract is not enforceable.</p>

<p>So I see the terms being offered me in the contract: less of something worthless in exchange for nothing, and I recognize this as being “insane”.  So I ignore it, and hope the angels will go away.  I am currently doing well at filling the aquarium, so I don’t want to be distracted by bad memories.  A month later I get another mass email.  Again I ignore it.  Another three mass emails come in March with some 40 people on the distribution, then 35, and then 30.  So clearly a number of people were signing up to these insane contracts.  Or maybe it somehow made more sense in their particular cases.</p>

<p>But then the dreaded day comes: an email to me specifically.  “We have not received your signed document… Can you please execute it today or tomorrow?” I respond that I could not see what was in it for me, and that I had lost well over $60K due to salary non-payment.  The first response from the angels’ is “everyone lost a lot of money”.</p>

<p>This is why I want anyone reading this book to take at least one thing about startups to heart.  You want to be an employee.  Employees are special.  They are <em>protected</em>.  I was about to find out how protected I was, and it was beyond my wildest dreams.</p>
