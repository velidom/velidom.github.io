  <h3>Gender</h3>

<p>Females are clearly the superior gender.  Put 100 women and 2 men on a deserted island, and they will have a great chance of building a thriving new community.  Reverse the numbers, and they will be lucky to survive the week.  So females are innately superior and the ratio should really be maybe 10 to 1 in their favor.  Unfortunately nature doesn’t seem to agree and makes the odds one to one.  And mothers, seeing the misshapen baby boys in front of them, take pity on the boys and raise them like their own.  Mothers are wonderful.</p>

<p>Whether men remember this blessing from women in their home life, they definitely don’t seem to remember it in their work world.  Women are treated very badly by men.  Some men may be intentionally treating women differently, and those men are “words I will not use in print”.  But I think the more insidious problem is that many men behave badly to <em>everyone</em> and it is just that women are currently more susceptible to the bad behavior.  Women would thrive in my very classy Startup #2 (DSG).  I think the many women in #3 (small Evant) were treated very well, but you would have to check with them.  One more startup after those might have been good to women.  So excluding my own, at best I would say in three of the nine startups I have been in, the spirit from the CEO downward would make sure women were treated well and equally.  That is 33%.</p>

<p>In the rest of the startups, I am minimally aware of some actual gender bigotry.  But I am totally aware of female-punishing activities.  One startup in particular had a CEO that was so strong willed, eloquent, handsome, and even ‘cute’ that it was hard for women to resist him.  Unfortunately for them, he was an optimizer, and wanted to optimize their salary, free time, and freedom away from them.  My interactions with him were fine.  I received significant promotions, raises, and independence.  Within a few months, I could do what I wanted to because of two things (a) I was visibly and dramatically helping him make his startup succeed, and (b) I made it completely clear in action that I would do what I wanted.  What I wanted were all the right things to make the company successful and the team happy.  But it also included walking out the door if anyone stopped me from doing what I wanted.  The CEO did not like the second rule, but he liked me.  A lot.  And respected me.  Also a lot.  He wrote my headline reference on LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them, that company had two women, both of which were treated badly.  One was paid poorly and forced to either never leave the office or to be on call any moment she did.  Another was paid poorly, even when she should have an amazing upper hand.  Even when she should had the power to walk.  Walk to a better life.</p>

<h3>Death</h3>

<p>Startups die.  The death of a startup is a hard thing for many people, but it is insanely hard for a founder.  As a founder it really feels like you gave birth to your company.  You raised it for at least two years.  It is a toddler or maybe a teenager.  And it is dying.  Worse than that.  It is dying and you are responsible for putting it down.</p>

<p>I have helped others keep companies alive until they were sold.  And I have watched startups die after I have left.  But the terminal illness of Velidom was so hard to take that I basically denied Velidom died at all.  Even to today.  It is my car’s license plate.</p>

<p>Because employees are ‘protected’ it is the founders responsibility to make sure the death of a startup does not poorly impact them.  They should have a good heads-up so they can find new jobs, and their final wages and PTO should be paid.  But the character of the CEO and the strain of the death of their child can make them behave badly.</p>

<p>There was a woman who was in a company that was clearly terminal.  The product was going nowhere.  The market was going nowhere.  They were making less and less, on fewer and fewer people.  The CEO didn’t believe in pivoting.  There was no more money.  There was absolutely no hope.</p>

<p>One day she came to talk to me and ask me for advice.  She had been offered a position in a large gaming startup down in Sunnyvale.  She was to be some kind of team lead, where currently she was just an individual programmer.  Or more accurately, she was the only programmer because the company could no longer afford any more.  She was lonely and wanted people to learn from.  But her current CEO/founder was telling her how important she was to him and the company.  How the company could make a turnaround, and she would be a critical part of that.  So she asked what should she do.</p>

<p>I told her exactly what I thought she should do.  It is exactly what I would do in her shoes.  I also explained to her what I wrote above.  The company is the founder’s baby.  The baby is all but dead.  This particular founder only really responded to assertive, forceful, and even aggressive actions positively.  And now the founder was suffering from delusions… of life… because it is his baby.  I explained to her that I know I suffered from the same delusions with Velidom.  I do not believe I hurt any employees in the process, and I am not the same kind of person as her founder.  But I have complete empathy for him.  And if I received the offer she had.  I would high tail it away from him (or from me) as fast as I could.</p>

<p>So that was my advice to her.  And given I was in a gaming startup at the time… I knew a fair amount about what other gaming startups were out there.  So I guessed which one she might have been given an offer by, that was located in Sunnyvale.  I told her if it was that company, she should run even faster.  She did not tell me that I was correct until later.</p>

<p>She did not take my advice, and continued working for the dead baby.  This was unfortunate, because the new company and position would likely have been good for her.  I think she could have used the money too.  If they offered her just 0.1% equity, she could have bought something nice.  Like a house.  The company was Playfish.</p>

<h3>Tea Parties</h3>

<p>I have never worked for a startup that was officially run by a woman.  That would actually be very interesting.  The best female bosses I have had, including my mother (I worked for her nonprofit when I was young), have managed to make sure the team knew where we were supposed to head, to clear away any obstacles, and to make us all feel like we were cared for.  That is very good management, in my opinion.  Some of the managers were a little more project management oriented, and status updates mattered a lot to them.  Some were a little less connected with the team.  But in general I have had excellent female managers over the last 30 years.</p>

<p>The closest I had to a startup run by women, was a startup run by a man and a woman where the man “managed like a woman”.  And by that, I mean it to match the expression “throw like a girl”.  In reality, girls throw really well.  I threw my arm out trying to pitch softball… and my daughter now pitches softball… so to me “throwing like my daughter” is clearly a complement.  Although women manage really well, there are stereotypes about how they might manage companies ineffectively.  This company somehow decided to follow one of those stereotypes.  This startup was run by tea party.</p>

<p>We would all get together several times a week, sit around a table, and bring up one or more topics.  Tea was not officially served, but certain people would definitely be eating.  Others would be lunging… apparently good exercise and socially acceptable at the tea party.  Topics would come and go, and by the end of the meeting we would have covered everything on the agenda.  Except absolutely nothing was decided.</p>

<p>There are great benefits to tea parties.  By deciding nothing each time, you could have many more tea parties and not run out of topics.  If you actually had a normal meeting, the number of topics would dwindle as the company truly executed upon an actual strategy.  There were times we had real meetings, and for a couple months I was hopeful.  But even actual forward progress can be thwarted by “maybe we need to rethink this”, and another series of tea parties.  Tea parties about user interfaces are my favorite.</p>

<h3>Boxes: Mavvi (continued)</h3>

<p>The second Mavvi experiment went well enough that people thought a third experiment was a good idea.  This time, I would be using Mavvi’s infrastructure (source code control, build environment, development tools) and Mavvi’s processes (in theory agile iterations, two week cadence, daily stand-ups, JIRA for tracking).</p>

<p>This time I would be building a mobile Custom Credit Card (C3) application.  You could sign up Mavvi customers for a custom Mavvi-branded credit card, anywhere in the store.  It was incredibly simple.  The UI needed to be mobile device (e.g. iPhone or iPad) oriented, but also capable of working on a cash register / POS.  There was some number of wireframes for what the UI should do when I started, and this was enough to get things done.  I had a “customer” that was a product manager.  That was all I really needed, and this could easily have been a repeat of the success that was the PeerCase ASH launch.  Unfortunately, I also had an “architect” that was anything but.</p>

<p>In software, an “architect” is either a sensible or puffy title.  It is a sensible title when the person is responsible for describing how everything works together.  Ideally the person should be at least partially responsible for implementing how everything works together.  That is a hands-on architect.  Hands-off architects are a bit puffier and more dangerous, but if they are good at describing things and will refine their designs with implementation feedback, they can be valuable.  Especially for people who are bad at documenting things themselves.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this “architect” had none of the above skills.  The “architect” was not skilled with any of the technologies involved with implementing C3.  They did not know how current C3 worked in the POS.  They did not know how the systems C3 talked to worked.  They were completely useless.  But worse than that, they wanted to tether their useless body onto me like this was a three-legged race.</p>

<p>At first I did not realize all of the above, and had faith the architect at least knew something about the systems that C3 talked to.  That turned out to be completely false, and I had to find others in Mavvi that had the appropriate knowledge.  Mavvi has many helpful people in it, but they are not a high percentage.</p>

<p>This C3 project was estimated as taking a total of 120 or so “Points” to deliver.  A “Point” is a completely abstract unit of estimation.  It is meant to be meaningless by itself, but it is clearly related to another concept: Ideal Person Hour (IPH).  An IPH is an hour of undistracted time for a single person, sitting at a good desk, with all the right tools.  I could figure out how much writing I get done with each IPH, and then figure out how many IPHs I have in a given day or week.  If I could get one page done per IPH and I want a 200-page book, it will take 200 IPHs to write the book.  And if I have 10 IPHs per week, it will take me about 20 weeks to finish a first content pass.</p>

<p>The concept of IPH makes complete sense, and we humans should be totally capable of using the term IPH.  With them we could do very sensible estimations, and planning.  Unfortunately the statement above “10 IPHs per week” causes many managers skin to crawl.  “What do you mean you only work for 10 hours a week!?!”, “I pay you for 40 hours a week, so you better be working for 40 hours a week”, “You said this will only take 4 hours to complete, please get it done today!”, and the idiocy goes on.  Having truly Ideal time is very difficult, so of course there is very little of it during the week.  But dealing with that “Ideal” term is simply impossible for certain people.  So some in the agile community fix the issue by using the term “Point”, “Jellybean”, and various other terms.  If I rewrite my estimation above it becomes: “If I could get one page done per Point… and if I can do 10 Points per week…”.  This new expression does not risk blowing up the minds of managers, so it is medically safer to use.</p>

<p>So back to Mavvi.  The C3 project is estimated at about 120 points, and Mavvi pairs do about 5 points per two-week period.  So if one pair was to work on C3 it would take them about 24 weeks, or almost half a year.  Similar to the second experiment in size.  The question is, how much time would it take me if I had to use all the Mavvi normal processes, except pairing.</p>

<p>There were a lot of inane aspects to Mavvi processes.  Test-driven development (crutch), mocking (crutch), and code analysis….</p>

<p>The answer turned out to be that I individually could produce between 25 and 50 points per iteration. I was 10 to 20 times faster than any Mavvi developer.  This productivity made my “customer” very happy.  She was getting working and improving software every week.  C3 was basically getting ready to ship.  Then the “architect” rebelled.</p>

<p>Actually, I can’t really call it rebellion because it appears to be what Mavvi wants to do to itself.  But it was disrespectful and unappreciative.  The behavior started a bit earlier, but to keep things short, I will start at the end.  The end began with a trip to Yosemite.</p>

<h3>Kindness: Karma</h3>

<p>As a reward for being a mentor to N, I had a great excuse to meet up with all the great artists I know from FooMojo and Rumble.  I shouldn’t really need an excuse because I like and respect them.  Maybe I would have done it eventually, so this was simply an acceleration of the process.  I wanted to make sure N had the best guidance possible, and although I am familiar with building great 3D video games, I am not skilled at it.</p>

<p>So very soon after meeting with N to find out his goals for his Quest, I set up a lunch with an artist at ILM (Industrial Light and Magic).  We have a very nice lunch, and I head next to Molinari’s to get some nice Italian food.  For fun, I take Lombard all the way and come down the very touristy wiggly hill.  I stop repeatedly to pause traffic and let walking tourists take nice photos on the hill.</p>

<p>After finishing with Molinari’s I call M.  M is a woman who was badly treated at one of my startups, and with whom I have a strong connection and relationship. Unfortunately, we don’t see each other very often because we both can be very busy, and she tends to work and live quite far from me.  But today, I have three or more hours to kill before going to an event at Nueva in Hillsborough.  I am in San Francisco, so whether M is in the city, in Daly City, in San Mateo, or almost anywhere I have ever heard her to be, I can get to her.</p>

<p>M answers my call, and says something about not being good company today.  I don’t care about that.  She may have said “I am putting my cat down”, but my iPhone garbles it.  I do care about that, but don’t want to discuss this over the phone.  I simply repeat: “I want to see you, tell me where you are”.</p>

<p>There is horrible traffic on the 101, but with a minor sneaky bypass, I manage to meet up with M at the San Mateo Animal Shelter…</p>

<p>Tiger has been alive for 17 years, or about 6000 days, or more than 60,000 daytime hours.  I never met Tiger before.  This would be the last hour of his life, and one of the most important hours in M’s life.  It was one of the most important hours in my life too.  I could be with someone whom I love and enjoy, who needed company whether they realized it or not, and I could help them.</p>

<p>I told M many stories and listened to hers.  We had pizza together as I waited for my daughter Maya to show up.  I wanted to show M how much she had grown.  But Maya and her entourage took their pizza out, so effectively never showed up.  M and I spent four hours together.  It was sad, but it was also happy.  It was special.  The odds were 1 in 60,000.</p>

<p>I now believe in Karma.  The world has been very kind to me.</p>
